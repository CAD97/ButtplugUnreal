# Buttplug (for) Unreal

An client implementation of the [Buttplug IoST Protocol][Buttplug] for Unreal
Engine. This adds support for controlling intimate haptic/sensor hardware
(read: sex toys) from Blueprint (preferred) and C++ (possible) by connecting
to a separate server application (typically [Intiface Central].

*Please* read the [Buttplug Developer Guide] before implementing Buttplug
support into your game. There are ethical implications to controlling intimate
hardware that should not be ignored, due to how your users interact with it.
This plugin's documentation only aims to describe the client-side *how* of
Buttplug control. The [Buttplug Developer Guide] covers the *what* and *why*.

## Installing

The simplest install method is to copy this plugin folder into your project. If
it is already a C++ project, the Unreal Editor will automatically recognize it
and compile it the next time you open the project.

If you have a pure Blueprint project or want an installation like with plugins
from the Marketplace, the plugin is packaged for Windows hosted development on
[the releases page][releases]. Navigate to the Unreal Engine's Plugin folder
(Program Files > Epic Games > UE_5.3 > Engine > Plugins), and add the plugin
folder there.

This plugin is *not* enabled by default. You will need to enable it from the
Plugins window in the editor (Edit > Plugins, IOT category).
